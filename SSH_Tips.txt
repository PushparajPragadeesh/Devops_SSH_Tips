RHEL changes:


ACCEPTED ANSWER
Changing PasswordAuthentication to yes in sshd_config is enough on Amazon Linux, but on RHEL PasswordAuthentication also appears in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf

[root@ip-172-31-13-116 ~]# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
PasswordAuthentication no
[root@ip-172-31-13-116 ~]# 
Either set it to yes again in here, or just comment it out sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication/#PasswordAuthentication/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf and then systemctl reload sshd and now users with a password set should be able to login using their password.





SSH Tips and tricks:

####copy public key to remote machine###

ssh-copy-id user@hostname

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i /home/ec2-user/ECCS.pem ec2-user@13.126.153.19 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

ssh -i /home/ec2-user/ECCS.pem ec2-user@13.126.153.19 "cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

echo public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

ssh sheena@192.168.0.11 "chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"


### change private key passphrase ##

ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p

## get The public key form PEM ###

ssh-keygen -y -f ssh-key.pem
